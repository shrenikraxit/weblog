                The game begins in silence — just eight cards and a chance to outthink your opponent.  
                Every choice carries risk, and the first mistake often decides the battle.  
                With the right timing, even a defense can become a victory.  
                This page uncovers the evolutions, decks, and cards that turn strategy into wins.

            <h2>What Is Clash Royale?</h2>
            <p>
                Clash Royale is a real-time strategy game created by Supercell where two players battle on a small arena with three towers each. 
                Every player brings a deck of eight cards made up of troops, spells, and buildings, and each card costs a certain amount of elixir to play.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main goal of the game is to destroy more towers than your opponent before the timer runs out. 
                Players place cards on the battlefield, and those troops automatically walk toward the enemy side, attacking anything in their way. 
                Because elixir slowly refills over time, good players must decide when to defend, when to attack, and how to get the most value from every card.

                        Evo Mega Knight is one of the best evolutions in Clash Royale because his upgraded spawn and jump
                        damage make him even more devastating at controlling pushes. He can wipe out swarms and severely
                        punish overcommitting opponents with ease, turning defense into a powerful counterattack.
                    </p>

                    <p class="deck-caption">
                        Evo Archers stand out thanks to their incredible burst damage and quick-fire capability. They shred
                        both swarms and high-HP units, making them versatile on offense and defense. Their pressure makes
                        them a top-tier evolution in many competitive decks.

                        Evo Knight gains boosted durability and stronger attacks, making him extremely reliable in almost
                        any matchup. For only 3 elixir, he controls space, soaks damage, and supports counterpushes with
                        consistent value.

                        Evo Goblin Barrel provides massive burst damage and forces precise responses from opponents. The
                        evolved Goblins hit harder, survive longer, and punish even small defensive mistakes, making it a
                        dominant win condition.

                    <p class="deck-caption">
                        This deck controls the tempo with strong defense and counter-pushing potential. Graveyard + Poison forces very specific responses, while Ice Wizard and Valkyrie provide reliable crowd control. It punishes mistakes and slowly chips towers down with safe pressure.
                    </p>

                <div class="column">
                    <img src="deck2.png" alt="Deck 2">
                    <p class="deck-caption">
                        This deck wins by constantly cycling Hog Rider faster than the opponent can defend. With cheap cards like Ice Spirit and Skeletons, you can rotate quickly and force damage even against strong defenses. A perfect choice for players with high game awareness and quick decision making.
                    </p>

                    <p class="deck-caption">
                        A true mind-game deck. It works by baiting out your opponent’s small spells with Goblin Barrel, Dart Goblin, and Princess. If they miscalculate once, you can take a full tower instantly. Ice Spirit gives cheap defense while Cannon stalls heavy pushes.
                    </p>

                    <p class="deck-caption">
                        This deck is built to constantly pressure both lanes. Miner chips damage while Balloon threatens full tower loss. Ice Golem tanks damage cheaply, and Bomb Tower controls heavy ground pushes. It’s amazing against players who overcommit or play slow tanks.

                        The Witch constantly spawns Skeletons to tank shots and distract troops, making her strong on defense.
                        When placed behind a tank, she can build a powerful counterpush.

                        Wall Breakers are a high-risk, high-reward pressure card. If the enemy mistimes their defense,
                        they explode for massive tower damage — all for just 2 elixir.

                        Miner can be placed anywhere in the arena, allowing players to chip towers or target backline troops.
                        He’s flexible and fits into many control or cycle decks.

                        The Log knocks back enemy troops, clears swarms, and chips towers.  
                        It’s one of the most efficient spells in the entire game for just 2 elixir.

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We are Shrenik and Wyatt — two Clash Royale players who enjoy learning the strategy behind the game, 
                not just playing it. We built this page to show how certain cards, evolutions, and decks work and 
                why they are strong in the current meta.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal isn’t to give “the best” deck, but to explain how players can think about card roles, 
                elixir value, defense, and counter-pushing. If someone reading this can build a better deck 
                or understand a matchup more clearly — then this page did its job.
